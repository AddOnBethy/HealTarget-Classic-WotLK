![Example 1](https://github.com/AddOnBethy/HealTarget-3.3.5/blob/main/example1.png?raw=true) ![Example 2](https://github.com/AddOnBethy/HealTarget-3.3.5/blob/main/example2.png?raw=true)

## Installation

Extract the folder called HealTarget into Classic\Interface\AddOns. Run the game. Enable AddOn in the in-game AddOn menu. (Should be enabled by default for first-time installers.)

## What does it do?

Whenever you cast a healing spell with a cast time greater than 0, the default cast bar shows who your target is, as well as which spell you are casting.

## Known bugs

 -- Unfortunately, there's no way to 100 % accurately get the target of your spell, which leads to wrong information whenever player switches targets right after starting a cast. There's really no fix for this (at least none that are known to me), so be warned.
